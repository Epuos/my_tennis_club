# my_tennis_club

 Example Django configuration project.
 This (more or less) follows the w3 tutorial on Django (https://www.w3schools.com/django/index.php), with a few extra bits and pieces thrown in.

A few comments:

1. This is being tracked via git. 
2. This is meant for education purposes.
3. The html/css part is still a work in progress and is likely to change.
4. There is a bulk import file for adding users to the db.sqlite3. There is also a csv file. You should edit the csv file for demonstration purposes.
